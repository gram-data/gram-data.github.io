Nodes\n    and Edges could be the towns and roads along the way. Where does\n    information about Route 66 itself go? \n    </p>\n    <p>This is the canonical use case of a Path as information structure.</p>\n\n    <Styled.h3>Shared Content</Styled.h3>\n    <p>A delivery truck driver steers a truck which physically contains packages that are owned (though not yet possed)\n      by other people. \n    </p>\n    <p>A graph model can happily express all the relationships, smoothly answering questions like, \n      \"where's my stuff?\" but requires external knowledge to \"get all the stuff\" inside the truck without also getting\n      the driver by accident. \n    </p>\n    <p>A document model can provide explicit containers for getting stuff in the truck, but optimizes for either \n      truck-oriented or owner-oriented queries.</p>\n    <p>A path model can do both explicitly in the data, without needing a schema or a written guidebook. </p>\n\n    <Styled.h3>Decorated Graphs - D3 DG</Styled.h3>\n    <p>D3.js has a lovely force-based network layout. Like many other libraries, the\n      algorithm annotates the graph with position data. Wouldn't it be nice to save\n      position and styling without compromising the domain data in the graph?\n    </p>\n    <p>Paths could achieve that by following an architectural pattern called an Entity-component-system (ECS),\n      a gift from the world of game development. Just wrap each Node (the entity) in a labeled Path (the system) to provide\n      system-specific information (the component).\n    </p>\n\n    <Styled.h3>Paths all the way down</Styled.h3>\n    <p>Nodes combine with Nodes to make Edges, which can be combined to make longer Paths.\n      A sequence of Paths combines everything into larger structures. Every Path combination, \n      from a single Node to a globe-spanning superstructure with all the intermediary Paths,\n      are complete, valid Graphs. \n    </p>\n\n    <Styled.h2>2. From nodes and edges, to paths</Styled.h2>\n    <p>Gram structures data as property graph paths.\n    In practice, that means you can write a graph \n    using Cypher paths like this:\n    </p>\n    <Styled.pre>{`\n    (a)-[e1]->(b)\n    (b)<-[e2]-(c)\n    `}</Styled.pre>\n    <p>The content values of a graph are attached to either nodes or edges:\n    </p>\n    <Styled.pre>{`\n    (a:Person {name:\"Wile E. Coyote\"})\n    (b:Company {name:\"Acme, Inc.\"})\n    (a)-[e1:CUSTOMER_OF]->(b)\n    `}</Styled.pre>\n    <p>In Cypher a path is a name bound to a path expression:\n    </p>\n    <Styled.pre>{`\n    p = (a)-[e1]->(b)<-[e2]-(c)\n    `}</Styled.pre>\n\n    <p>Gram adopts the square brackets used by relationships to also delimit a path.\n      This provides room for labels and records to be attached to a path:\n    </p>\n    <Styled.pre>{`\n    [p:TROUBLESOME {accidents:12000} (a)-[e1]->(b)]\n    // or just...\n    [p:TROUBLESOME {accidents:12000} e1]\n    `}</Styled.pre>\n\n\n    <Styled.h2>3.
